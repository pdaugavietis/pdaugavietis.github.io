My name is Peter Daugavietis.
I have a certain set of skills.   I just wish I knew what they were...

## Personal
I am married to an amazing woman (for 17 years and counting!) with whom we had 2 amazing daughters - eldest in high school now (where did that time go?) and youngest in grade 7 (same question).

We live just the otherside of "Middle of Nowhere" in the area called Trent Hills.   We have about 8 acres of land, mostly hardwood forest, and on an actual country lane.   All the pictures you'll see used in various spots around this site were taken by either me or my wife, all around the area we live - because it's stunning.  At night you can see actual stars (assuming the damned clouds aren't in the way), painted on the biggest canvas there is.

## Professional
Been a tech monkey since I was in middle school (and even earlier) rocking the computers since [Timex Sinclair 1000](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Zx81-timex-manipulated.jpg), [Commodore C64](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Commodore-64-Computer-FL.jpg/2560px-Commodore-64-Computer-FL.jpg) and really starting with an [IBM PCjr](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Ibm_pcjr_with_display.jpg) that I got from my uncle who used to work at IBM (and juiced it up a little).

Then thru the PC XT, AT, 386 all the way to today, where I have to admit I'm a bit of a Mac-head, but heavily a Linux user (RHEL/Centos, Ubuntu).   Started as a Help Desk Analyst, bumped to Jr Programmer (Windows/Access/Visual Basic); evolved to Sr Programmer Analyst in [Java](https://java.oracle.com) tools and part time DBA (SQL Server and DB2 Windows); jumped to SDLC tooling engineer and release management; starting doing DevOps before it was a buzzword and [automating](https://www.ansible.com/) all the [things](https://puppet.com) with "everything-as-code"; now a devops/platform engineer with skills in Agile processes, [Atlassian tooling](https://www.atlassian.com), skills in training and workshops, and helping clients get to where they want and need to go.

For the punchline on this (if you're interested - if not, don't blame you! :)), take a peek at my [resume here](https://pdaugavietis.github.io/cv/).
