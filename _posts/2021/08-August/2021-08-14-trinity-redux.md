I mentioned that DevOps is a trinity of People, Process and Tools; and we started with this:

    In Information Technology (IT), and especially in DevOps, there is a common trinity of People, Processes, and Tools.

I was talking with some other business folks (not necessarily IT centric), and they proposed the following:

    In Business, and especially in technology, there is a common trinity of People, Processes, and Tools.

I think that this is important driver that we're seeing more of in the last few years, of moving IT out of the cost-center (black-hole for money) mentality, and making IT a core partner in the business in general.  This is very common theme throughout many industries, and a cornerstone of highly successful businesses as well.

What doesn't necessarily get as much airtime, is what lies within the boundaries of that trinity - the culture and principles of the organization that drive the policies decided upon, the tools used, and the people that are hired.  There are several guiding ideals that we should talk about that help drive a 'healthy' and 'safe' Agile and DevOps culture.

# Learning and Discovery over Blame and Shame

> “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” - Thomas A. Edison

> “Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.” - C.S. Lewis

There is an inherent fear of failing that we all have.  Along the same lines, we don't want to be blamed for something not working, or for going off the rails.  This is a natural reaction to the discomfort of having our shortcomings pointed out to us.  On the flip side of that, we love getting praise for a job well done, and mission accomplished!  The most important aspect of a successful endeavour is not just the achievement itself, but in the voyage of discovery that you were on to get there; the lessons learned, the wisdom earned.

Finding something in the unknown, should be the focus of a given task, whether or not you end up being successful or not.  It's also changing the culture of fear, to one of psychological safety that enables teams to take more risks, and navigate the path to success; without getting caught up in the 'blame game' and being mired in negative outcomes.

# We Should All Row in the Same Direction

> "Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results." -Andrew Carnegie

Transparency is pretty simple -- let's all know what each other is doing and why.  This is straightforward for inside each team, but can get murkier as we start to consider mulitple teams, and more so with multiple levels of an organization.  The solutions to this is both simple and slightly vexing (sometimes): meetings!  But in fairness, meetings are only one way of communicating between layers of the org; online chats work for this, AMA sessions (either online or in-person), and generally publishing information to be consumed to a wiki or something also accomplish this quite nicely.

Collaboration between teams and members is also critical; if some people are moving in a different direction (and not by design, ala 'Skunkworks' or R&D), that's also a concern.  Communication provides the transparency, but you have to actually work together and accomplish work to be really collaborative.  This means usually also more cross-functional teams, as the devs will help with DBA and testing tasks (making them better coders), the QA teams will pick up a little coding here and there (making them better at understanding why a test might be failing); and the organization will get a richer skilled, and much more competent workforce.
