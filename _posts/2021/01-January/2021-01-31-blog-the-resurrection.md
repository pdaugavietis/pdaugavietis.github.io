Okay so I'm actually going to try and document things here, and work on pushing out some actual content.  You can expect to be mostly technical, since I am a weenie for such things.

    - AWS related stuff
    - container related stuff
    - DevOps (and DevOops)
    - Metrics and Logging

But I might start putting other things here too, thoughts and musing about what's going on; taking time for ourselves; and giving time back to those around us, by picking up the pace a bit. We have a front deck to build out, so that might be something, and also redoing a bathroom.

We'll see what I end up putting up...
